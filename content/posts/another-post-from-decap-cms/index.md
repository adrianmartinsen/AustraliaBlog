title: Another post from Decap CMS

For some reason the posts created in Decap CMS do not show up on the site. They get committed, Netlify rebuilds the site, but the posts do not show. If I pull to my local repo and try running it locally it worked. Then, if I created a new post locally and committed manually everything showed up. Not sure what is going on there.

Also, the featured image does not show up, but I assume that is because there is something wrong with the template.
