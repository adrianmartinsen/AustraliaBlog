The kids started school this week so we are finally getting some 
normality. It was a tough start on Monday morning, but we gradually get 
into the rhythm of things by the end of the week. Just in time to have 
two more weeks of vacation! That's just poor timing. As they have 
trimesters we happened to get here in time for the end of the first 
trimester. At least the girls seemed to get along well with their new 
class mates and teachers so that bodes well for when they start back.

## Walking, walking everywhere!

One
 thing that is very clear after not having a car for over a month is 
that you walk a lot. Like a lot, a lot. I turned on a step tracker on my
 phone for the fun of it and this week I have reached 85.000 steps. How 
accurate it is I am not sure, but if nothing else I can feel it in my 
feet and legs. Just as an example it is 1.3km (0.8 miles) from our house to
 the kids school. I walk them to school in the morning and then I go 
home again. In the afternoon I do the same to pick them up. That is 
5.2km (3.23 miles) just there. And if you want to take the bus or the 
train you still have to walk to the bus stop or station. Hopefully my 
feet will get used to it and not be so sore in the future.

## National gallery, botanical gardens and war memorials

The
 week went fast as it generally does when kids have school and you have 
to drop off, pick up and make dinner. That leaves the weekend for the 
fun of exploring a new place. On Saturday Anna and Kassandra went to the
 National Gallery to see an exhibit by Yayoi Kusama. Lots of polka dots 
apparently. You even got to stick a few on the wall yourself. Isabelle 
and I stayed home as she was not feeling well. It might have been all 
chocolate she ate during the week as they celebrated Easter at school. 
But today we all headed to the botanical gardens. Because of a 
charity run downtown the tram stop where we get off the train was closed
 so we had to walk (like I said, walking everywhere). So after having 
walked to the gardens we only explored a tiny portion as the Royal 
Botanical Gardens are huge. But we also got to enjoy Queen Victoria 
Gardens which is a public park that we walked through to get there. So 
we got to see a few statues, a bunch of sculptures and some memorials 
before we got to see a some interesting flora. As we walked by the 
Shrine of Remembrance we decided to get up to the lookout balcony before
 we left. So all in all we did a day with a lot of walking, but also 
some interesting things to see along the way.
