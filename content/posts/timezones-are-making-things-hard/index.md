So my last post about changing the version does not seem to have made a difference. However, I noticed that the only thing that is different between a post created by the CMS and a manual one is the datetime format. Specifically the timezone. Now that I have adjusted the timezone format in the config for the CMS hopefully this post will show with no further issues.

Fingers crossed!
