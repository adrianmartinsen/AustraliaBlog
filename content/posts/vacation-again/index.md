title: Vacation. Again.

After only one week of school the kids have yet more vacation. It was 
good to have that week to get used to going to a new school in a 
different country. Let's hope that going back after the break is more 
seamless than it was last week. But more vacation means finding more 
things to do. Not that we have run out of things to do in the city, but 
Anna has school to deal with as there are assignments due. That leaves 
me to activate the kids and we did get around to a few things this week.

## Swim class for Isabelle
The
 local swimming pool that is about a 20 minutes walk away offer 
intensive swim lessons during school break. That means a 30 minute 
lesson each day, Monday through Friday. Perfect! So each morning 
Isabelle and I headed out the door at 9 o'clock. Almost like as if she 
was going to school. The class only has 4 participants and they are 
grouped by skill level. That meant Isabelle got to learn with kids her 
own age and at her level. She really enjoyed herself and had some good 
progression during the week culminating in swimming unaided on her back 
across the pool and back. All in all a great experience for her and 
definitely something we will go back to next time school is off.

## Still settling in
We
 might be approaching a month in our apartment, but we are still getting
 things together. This week we got some shelving so we don't need to 
store things on the floor. A nice improvement as it feels less 
cluttered. The washing machine we purchased was a little wonky, but the 
company we bought it from were very helpful trying to troubleshoot the 
problem and in the end they came and exchanged the machine. If you ever 
find yourself looking for white goods in Melbourne I can highly 
recommend DMS Appliances. I have rarely experience such great customer 
service.

## Back to the Zoo
We are experiencing a resurgence of 
summer as the temperature got up to 30C (about 86 Fahrenheit). We 
debated going to the beach, but in the end we figured going back to the 
Zoo would be more fun. This time we brought a pick nick and again we had
 some great animal experiences. As we didn't get through everything last
 time we got to try a few new exhibits like the reptiles. There were 
some amazing snakes and lizard. But we of course had to see our favorite
 exhibit which is the Kangaroo and Emu enclosure. This time we got to 
get up close to a Kangaroo and she had a Joey in her pouch! Amazing.

Not
 sure what we are doing today yet. We were planning on going to the 
beach, but after yesterday another day in the sun doesn't sound too 
appealing. It should be just as warm, if not warmer today. So maybe we 
will try the movie theater. The coming week also has plenty of warm 
weather predicted so we can save the beach for another day. 

Have some technical issues this week so no pictures.
