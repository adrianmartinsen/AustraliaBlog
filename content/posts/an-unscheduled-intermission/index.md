As some may be aware, Anna's father passed this week. As his health had been deteriorating these past month so this was sadly not unexpected, although the death of a loved one is never easy. We were already preparing a return to Norway to say out goodbyes when we received the news of his passing. So instead of a trip to see him one last time, it turned into a trip to attend his funeral.Â 


For the next few weeks we are going to spend time with family so there will not be any updates to this blog during that time. Maybe I'll get around to a recapping these weeks once we return to Australia.
