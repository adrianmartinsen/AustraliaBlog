Well, technically, it started two weeks ago when Anna left for Melbourne. She has been settling in and trying to find a place for us to live, all while she has orientation at school. But she still found time to explore and enjoy the beach, although this weekend it resulted in a massive sunburn on her legs!

And while Anna is having fun by herself the kids and I are just waiting to get on an airplane this weekend. We will take off from Gardermoen on Saturday afternoon and due to the time difference we land on Monday morning in Melbourne. Fingers crossed it all goes well!
